A seasoned IT professional with over 15 years of experience as an IT Manager and 2 years as a DevOps Engineer. I am a highly analytical, solution-oriented, and resourceful individual with extensive knowledge in network administration, server support, and application support. 

In my previous role as an IT Manager, I demonstrated the ability to deliver creative and relevant server and application strategies through comprehensive problem-solving skills. I have expertise in troubleshooting and administration for all Microsoft operating systems and many Linux Operating Systems.

Transitioning into a DevOps Engineer role, I have continued to leverage my problem-solving skills and technical expertise to streamline operations, enhance collaboration between development and operations teams, and maintain high-quality, continuous delivery of applications and services.

My career journey has equipped me with a unique blend of skills in both management and technical domains, enabling me to understand and bridge the gap between these areas in IT projects. I am excited to bring this holistic approach to future roles and challenges.
