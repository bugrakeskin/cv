The company I worked for decided to move the project from an on-premise environment to AWS. Before this decision, I was managing 12 remote servers and a Proxmox with 120 VMs. Some of the technologies we used include: MongoDB, Rancher-k8s, k3s, Kong-Gateway, Redis, Proxmox, Ansible, Harbor, Graylog, etc. During the transition to AWS, I ensured the completion of the transition process by finding the AWS equivalents of these systems

- Choosing the right deployment models
- Conducting the testing protocol and critical monitoring
- Automation of repetitive tasks
- Provide the server support and the application support
- Ensure that the backup is sufficient, and if there isnâ€™t any adequate backup, then you have to create a backup policy as well.
